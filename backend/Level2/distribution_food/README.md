We currently want to allow the user to benefit from restaurant cards. Distributions of meal vouchers work the same way as distributions of gift vouchers with an exception on the validity date. In fact, meal vouchers expire at the end of February of the year following the date of distribution.

For example: if the date of the distribution is 01/01/2020, the end of the distribution is 02/28/2021.

Likewise, if the distribution starts on 01/15/2020 it will also end on 02/28/2021.

- Implement the function allowing the company to distribute meal vouchers.
- Use this function to generate the expected result in the output-expected.json file.
